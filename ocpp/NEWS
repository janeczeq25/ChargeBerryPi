09 oct 2013; ocppjs 1.0.2

  * Added constraints in JSON Schema (enumerations, maxLength, etc)
    documentation. Simulator now enforces these constraints when verifying
    incoming messages.
  * Added JSON Schema control for MeterValues & StopTransaction message.
  * Fixed missing namespace for nested object in SOAP.
  * Fixed missing value in the "To" header for SOAP remote actions.

04 oct 2013; ocppjs 1.0.1

  * Added JSON Schema for requests and responses in the documentation files.
  * Changed the way XML attributes are mapped to JSON. In practice, this only
    changes the format for OCPP1.5 MeterValues & StopTransaction request
    messages.
    The central system simulator doesn't enforce this format yet, and will
    accept anything under the StopTransactionRequest.transactionData and
    MeterValuesRequest.values fields when receiving a message.
  * Added package.json file for easier installation.
  * Fixed invalid JSON example for OCPP1.2 MeterValuesRequest.
  * Fixed action name and namespaces issues with SOAP transport.

03 jun 2013; ocppjs 1.0.0

  * Fixed ocpp1.5 JSON payload structure for:
    . GetConfiguration request: "key" was a string instead of an array of
      strings
    . GetConfiguration response: "unknownKey" was a string instead of an array
      of strings
    . MeterValues & StopTransaction request: "value" was an int instead of
      an array of strings, "@value" was a object instead of an array of objects
  * Added websocket protocol name when accepting a new connection.
  * Added a plugin system allowing to define the behavior of a CS or CP
    simulator:
    . 'plugins', 'load' and 'unload' commands for listing, loading
      and unloading plugins.
    . Plugin API documentation and tutorial in
      plugins/getting_started_with_plugins.html.
    . 'cbxs' chargepoint plugin example with connectors management.
  * Minor fixes

02 may 2013; ocppjs 0.0.11

  * Added: framework for writing unit tests and 4 example files (in test/).
  * Payload errors are now supported in SOAP mode.
  * 'send_raw' and 'remote_send_raw' commands are now available in SOAP mode.
    . Added parameter -h for printing http headers.
  * In SOAP mode, header 'From' retrieves the local IP address instead of using
    'localhost'.

22 apr 2013; ocppjs 0.0.10

  * Added SOAP transport support in Central system simulator.
  * Added SOAP remote actions support:
    . Added parameter -r in 'start_cp' command, defining the listening
      port for remote actions. If not defined, it defaults to the port specifed
      in the 'wsa5:From' URL.
    . Added parameter -f in 'start_cp' command, defining the "wsa5:From"
      URL in SOAP header. If not defined, it defaults to
      'http://localhost:random_port'.
    . 'send' and 'send_raw' commands have been disabled for the SOAP mode.
    . This version does not detect SOAP payload errors yet.

09 apr 2013; ocppjs 0.0.9

  * SOAP client integration:
    . Requires third-party libraries: 'node-expat' and 'request'.
    . Added parameter -t for the 'start_cp' command in order to choose the
      simulator transport layer (websocket or SOAP).
    . Added 'set print_xml' command for displaying SOAP envelopes in XML format.
    . Remote actions and Central system simulator are not supported yet with
      soap transport.
  * New JSON attributes syntax: {"node":"value","@node":{"attr1": "value1"}}.

14 mar 2013; ocppjs 0.0.8

  * WebSocket ping enhancements :
    . Added client websocket ping.
    . Added parameter '-i' for the 'start_cp' command in order to set the
      WebSocket ping frequency.
    . Added 'websocket_ping_cs' and 'websocket_ping_cp' commands for manually
      sending one WebSocket ping from a central system simulator or a charge
      point simulator.
    . Added 'set' command for modifying the WebSocket ping frequency without
      interrupting the simulator (0 for disabling WebSocket pings).
  * 'tns:MeterValue' type is now supported. doc/gir-ocppjs-doc.js has been
  updated with the expected JSON structure for types with XML schema attributes
  attributes. The MeterValue type in ocpp 1.5 is currently the only one with
  such a structure.
  * Added 'InternalError' support when a procedure raises an exception.
  * Added payload error checking for CALLRESULT messages.
  * Prompt '>' now shows up right after entering a command.

07 mar 2013; ocppjs 0.0.7

  * Payload parsing now supports complex types and simple type restrictions.
  * Procedure call messages can be customized from command line interface using
    the new 'argument=value' syntax.
  * OCPP 1.2 & OCPP 1.5 commands are completely covered with the addition of
    firmware and diagnostics messages.
  * Enhancement of the command line interface reliability: bugfixes and
    deletion of multiple spaces.
  * Simulator is now tolerant to WSDL absence and can be launched from
    any directory.

27 feb 2013; ocppjs 0.0.6

  * Basic payload parsing (Property/Occurence/TypeConstraintViolation for
    simple types). Complex types and restrictions are not checked yet.
  * Commands schema is now loaded from wsdl files. This requires:
    . An additional third-party library: xml2js.
    . Valid ocpp wsdl files in doc/wdsl subdirectory. They are provided in the
      zip file.
  * A CentralSystem simulator can now support multiple comma-separated protocol
    versions on a single endpoint.
  * New commands:
    . 'send' & 'remote_send' to send a custom message in a valid envelope, to
      simulate invalid procedure names and payloads.
    . 'send_raw' & 'remote_send_raw' to send a custom string, to simulate
      invalid envelopes.

20 feb 2013; ocppjs 0.0.5

  * Conformance to DRAFT1 specification.
  * Updated command-line interface. start_cp & start_cs commands can now be
    passed directly as shell arguments.
  * Removed automatic bootnotification & heartbeat. All messages are
    triggered manually (type 'help' to get the list), except websocket ping.
  * Completed the command set to cover usual ocpp1.2 and ocpp1.5 commands (not
    available yet: firmware & diagnotics messages).

14 feb 2013; DRAFT1

  * First public draft specificaton.
  * Removed chargeBoxIdentity from message payload.

01 feb 2013; ocppjs 0.0.4

  * Added doc/gir-ocppjs-doc.js: autogenerate JSON examples from OCPP wsdl.

23 jan 2013; ocppjs 0.0.3

  * Added websocket ping interval in centralsystem simulator.
  * Added websocket logging for ping/pong frames.

11 jan 2013; ocppjs 0.0.2

  * Updated logs.
  * Bugfixes.

28 dec 2012; ocppjs 0.0.1
